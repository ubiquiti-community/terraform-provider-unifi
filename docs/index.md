# Unifi Provider

The UniFi provider is used to interact with UniFi Controller resources. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

The Unifi provider provides resources to interact with a Unifi controller API.

It is not recommended to use your own account for management of your controller. A user specific to
Terraform is recommended. You can create a **Limited Admin** with **Local Access Only** and
provide that information for authentication. Two-factor authentication is not supported in the provider.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "unifi" {
  username = var.username # optionally use UNIFI_USERNAME env var
  password = var.password # optionally use UNIFI_PASSWORD env var
  api_url  = var.api_url  # optionally use UNIFI_API env var
  api_key  = var.api_key  # optionally use UNIFI_API_KEY

  # you may need to allow insecure TLS communications unless you have configured
  # certificates for your controller
  allow_insecure = var.insecure # optionally use UNIFI_INSECURE env var

  # if you are not configuring the default site, you can change the site
  # site = "foo" or optionally use UNIFI_SITE env var
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `allow_insecure` (Boolean) Skip verification of TLS certificates of API requests. You may need to set this to `true` if you are using your local API without setting up a signed certificate. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_INSECURE` environment variable. Ignored when `cloud_connector` is enabled.
- `api_key` (String, Sensitive) API key for the Unifi controller. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_API_KEY` environment variable. If this is set, the `username` and `password` fields are ignored.
- `api_url` (String) URL of the controller API. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_API` environment variable. You should **NOT** supply the path (`/api`), the SDK will discover the appropriate paths. This is to support UDM Pro style API paths as well as more standard controller paths.
- `cloud_connector` (Boolean) Use UniFi Cloud Connector API to access the controller. When enabled, requires `api_key` authentication and automatically routes requests through https://api.ui.com. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_CLOUD_CONNECTOR` environment variable. The `api_url` field is ignored when this is enabled.
- `hardware_id` (String) Hardware ID of the UniFi console to connect to when using Cloud Connector. If not specified, defaults to the first console where owner=true. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_HARDWARE_ID` environment variable. Only used when `cloud_connector` is enabled.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the user accessing the API. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_PASSWORD` environment variable.
- `site` (String) The site in the Unifi controller this provider will manage. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_SITE` environment variable. Default: `default`
- `username` (String, Sensitive) Local user name for the Unifi controller API. Can be specified with the `UNIFI_USERNAME` environment variable.

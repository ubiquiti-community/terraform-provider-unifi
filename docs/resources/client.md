# Client (Resource)

Manages a client of the network, identified by unique MAC addresses.

Clients are created in the controller when observed on the network, so the resource defaults to allowing itself to just take over management of a MAC address, but this can be turned off.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "unifi_network" "my_vlan" {
  name    = "wifi-vlan"
  purpose = "corporate"

  subnet       = "10.0.0.1/24"
  vlan_id      = 10
  dhcp_start   = "10.0.0.6"
  dhcp_stop    = "10.0.0.254"
  dhcp_enabled = true
}

resource "unifi_client" "test" {
  mac  = "01:23:45:67:89:AB"
  name = "some client"
  note = "my note"

  fixed_ip   = "10.0.0.50"
  network_id = unifi_network.my_vlan.id
}
```

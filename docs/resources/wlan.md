# unifi_wlan (Resource)

Manages a WiFi network / SSID in UniFi Controller

## Example Usage

```terraform
variable "vlan_id" {
  default = 10
}

data "unifi_ap_group" "default" {
}

data "unifi_user_group" "default" {
}

resource "unifi_network" "vlan" {
  name    = "wifi-vlan"
  purpose = "corporate"

  subnet       = "10.0.0.1/24"
  vlan_id      = var.vlan_id
  dhcp_start   = "10.0.0.6"
  dhcp_stop    = "10.0.0.254"
  dhcp_enabled = true
}

resource "unifi_wlan" "wifi" {
  name       = "myssid"
  passphrase = "12345678"
  security   = "wpapsk"

  # enable WPA2/WPA3 support
  wpa3_support    = true
  wpa3_transition = true
  pmf_mode        = "optional"

  network_id    = unifi_network.vlan.id
  ap_group_ids  = [data.unifi_ap_group.default.id]
  user_group_id = data.unifi_user_group.default.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The SSID of the network.
- `security` (String) The type of WiFi security for this network.
- `user_group_id` (String) ID of the user group to use for this network.

### Optional

- `bss_transition` (Boolean) Improves client roaming by providing connection details of nearby APs.
- `fast_roaming_enabled` (Boolean) Enable fast roaming, aka 802.11r.
- `hide_ssid` (Boolean) Indicates whether or not to hide the SSID from broadcast.
- `is_guest` (Boolean) Indicates that this is a guest WLAN and should use guest behaviors.
- `l2_isolation` (Boolean) Isolates stations on layer 2 (ethernet) level.
- `mac_filter_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether or not the MAC filter is turned of for the network.
- `mac_filter_list` (Set of String) List of MAC addresses to filter (only valid if `mac_filter_enabled` is `true`).
- `mac_filter_policy` (String) MAC address filter policy (only valid if `mac_filter_enabled` is `true`).
- `minimum_data_rate_2g_kbps` (Number) Minimum data rate for 2G clients in Kbps.
- `minimum_data_rate_5g_kbps` (Number) Minimum data rate for 5G clients in Kbps.
- `minrate_setting_preference` (String) Minimum rate setting preference.
- `multicast_enhance` (Boolean) Indicates whether or not Multicast Enhance is turned of for the network.
- `no2ghz_oui` (Boolean) Connect high performance clients to 5 GHz only.
- `passphrase` (String, Sensitive) The passphrase for the network, this is only required if `security` is not set to `open`.
- `pmf_mode` (String) Enable Protected Management Frames. This cannot be disabled if using WPA 3.
- `proxy_arp` (Boolean) Reduces airtime usage by allowing APs to "proxy" common broadcast frames as unicast.
- `radius_profile_id` (String) ID of the RADIUS profile to use when security `wpaeap`.
- `schedule` (Block List) Start and stop schedules for the WLAN (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--schedule))
- `site` (String) The name of the site to associate the WLAN with.
- `uapsd` (Boolean) Enable Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery.
- `wpa3_support` (Boolean) Enable WPA 3 support (security must be `wpapsk` and PMF must be turned on).
- `wpa3_transition` (Boolean) Enable WPA 3 and WPA 2 support (security must be `wpapsk` and `wpa3_support` must be true).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of the WLAN.

<a id="nestedblock--schedule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `schedule`

Required:

- `day_of_week` (String) Day of week for the block.
- `duration` (Number) Length of the block in minutes.
- `start_hour` (Number) Start hour for the block (0-23).

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name of the block.
- `start_minute` (Number) Start minute for the block (0-59).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# import from provider configured site
terraform import unifi_wlan.mywlan 5dc28e5e9106d105bdc87217

# import from another site
terraform import unifi_wlan.mywlan bfa2l6i7:5dc28e5e9106d105bdc87217
```
